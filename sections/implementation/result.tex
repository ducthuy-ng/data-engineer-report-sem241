\subsection{Demo results}

Because our project are primarily Google Cloud based, it is really difficult for us to have an
export for the result that we have been working on. We came to a conclusion to embed the Github
link, a repository containing all the script and query that we used to configured the
infrastructure. Also, this report is also published online.
